                <h2>Modern Interior Style</h2>
                <h3>Key attributes of modern interior design style include:</h3>
                <ul class="modern">
                    <li>Absence of ornament,</li>
                    <li>Intentional asymmetry,</li>
                    <li>No clutter or chaos,</li>
                    <li>Art, rather than accessories, and</li>
                    <li>Open floor plans</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Modern interior designers are also described as super “sleek” since they have an unparalleled love for simple palettes and designs that are often coupled with clean, crisp angles, and lines</p>

            <h2>Transitional Interior Design</h2>
            <h3>Transitional interior design elements include:</h3>
            <ul class="modern">
                <li>Limited use of accessories,</li>
                <li>Curved furnishings with straight-lined lacquered finishes,</li>
                <li>Use of impactful art as focal points,</li>
                <li>Neutral color palette, and</li>
                <li>Textural elements such as wood, glass, lacquer, rattan, fabric, steel and metal.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It’s extremely popular right now among designers. In fact, it’s very easy to confuse contemporary with transitional and in fact for both types it’s often easy to argue a particular interior design is one or the other.</p>

        <h2> Scandinavian Interior Design</h2>
        <h3>Scandinavian design elements include:</h3>
        <ul class="modern">
            <li>Predominantly white,</li>
            <li>Bright colors combine with the main white color,</li>

        </ul>
        <p>Their designs are a true representation of pared-back coziness, a myriad of textures and some clean, refined lines. They are a beautiful work of art, but always so simple and subtle. Scandinavian designs are big on space, fewer accessories, natural light flowing in, and minimal furniture that serves some purpose.</p>
